Introduction

It can be important to have a development environment that is as close to a production environment as possible. Having realistic development (or staging) environment helps business users visualise what an end product (or solution) will look like when deployed.

The following PowerShell (and accompanying name files) demonstrates creating 2000 unique Active Directory domain accounts, including setting different locations, departments, phone numbers and gender (male or female). Each domain account has a photo uploaded to Active Directory. Finally, SharePoint User Profile synchronization is configured, to import the users and their photos.
