Overview:

Visual Studio 2012 solution that connects to a SharePoint list or document library and extracts list fields and items to a spread sheet. You can then add terms from 'term sets' against one or more Managed Metadata fields that have term sets associated with the Managed Metadata column.

Prerequisites:

The SharePoint list or document library you are going to run the solution against must have at least one column that has been created as a 'Managed Metadata' column and is bound to a term set.

Usage Notes:

-- SharePoint 2013 Automate tagging fields with terms (CSOM) --

1. Open your 'SPAutomatedTaggingClient' solution in the \C# folder

2. Open the 'Program.cs' file and edit the following:

Line 76: Program.clientContext = new ClientContext("http://localhost/");

- Change the 'http://localhost' path URL to match your environment

Line 78: List list = Program.clientContext.Web.Lists.GetByTitle("Documents");

- Change the 'Documents' name to match your list / document library name

Line 102: #if true

- Change this to 'true' to generate the 'AutomatedTagging.csv' file
- Using a 'false' value imports the 'AutomatedTagging.csv' file

3. Press F5 to build your project and look for the 'AutomatedTagging.csv' file in either your 'Debug' or 'Release' bin folder:

\C#\SPAutomatedTaggingClient\bin\Debug
\C#\SPAutomatedTaggingClient\bin\Release

4. You can then use the 'SPAutomatedTaggingClient.exe' application from the 'Debug' or 'Release' bin folder on your SharePoint servers

Testing Notes:

Use "" double quotes around any terms that have special characters in them like ',' commas
Sync doesn't appear to be both ways in that if you remove a term from the CSV file; the term still appears in the list
Sync does however appear to update terms if you update them in the CSV file
Sync isn't case sensitive for terms
When run against list libraries the CSV file doesn't list item names by their 'friendly name'
