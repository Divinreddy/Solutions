== Search Centre provisioning ==

If you provision a Site Template apart from a Collaboration Portal (SPSPORTAL#0); SPInstaller won't provision search service for you - still need to manually create the search centre to match the URL you set

Note: The Collaboration Portal (SPSPORTAL#0) provisions the sites below

- Document Center
- News
- Search (Important bit here is that the Search site gets provisioned with the following default path to the Enterprise Search Center Template - /SearchCenter/)
- Sites

Site Settings : Sites and Workspaces  

Create a site using the Enterprise --> Enterprise Search Center Template

Map your site collection to the search center

Site Collection Administration Search Settings  
 
Enter a Search Center URL - provide the URL you specified in your SPInstaller script and have just created
